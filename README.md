# To DO

Check output files: not sure that the pointing az is defined in the right way (according to simtel standards)
Add a warning for times: the scripts work with UTC times, not local ones (paranal = UTC - 3h)
Create default input configurations for alpha and baseline config (missing alpha north, soon solved)
